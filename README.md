* On Heroku Website https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps , New -> Create New App
* Choose App name and region.
* Use Resources - Addons - Heroku Postgres

* In gitpod:
- pip3 install dj_database_url
- pip3 install psycopg2-binary
- pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

* In settings.py
- `import dj_database_url`

```
# DATABASES = {
#    'default': {
#        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
#        'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
#    }
#}


DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse('postgress-url-goes-here')
}
```
* NB Get url from Heroku App settings tab / reveal config vars.

* Run migrations again (different database)

* `python3 manage.py showmigrations` Will show none exist

* `python3 manage.py migrate`

* To import product data, use fixtures:
- `python3 manage.py loaddata categories`
- `python3 manage.py loaddata products`
- NB categories must be created first as products depend on them.

* Create superuser account in the new database
- `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`


NB DO NOT COMMIT DATABASE URL TO VERSION CONTROL.

* Update settings.py to connect to a different database depending on if this is deployed or production version:

```
if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    }
```

* `pip3 install gunicorn`
* `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`
* Create `Procfile` in root folder with the contents `web: gunicorn race_hub.wsgi:application`

* NB: Check folder for Procfile is correct

* In terminal:
- 'heroku login' or 'heroku login -i'
- `heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app race-hub`

* In settings.py `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['race-hub.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']`
* NB must be wrapped in `` above.

* If the app was created on the heroku website, set the remote repo. `heroku git:remote -a race-hub-ado`

* to check: `git remote -v`

* The great moment! `git push heroku master`

* To deploy to github automatically:
- In Heroku web interface:
- Deploy -> Github
- Select repo and connect.
- Enable automatic deploys

* https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/ 
- Add this to Heroku -> Config Vars -> Add the secret_key
-  Update settings.py to contain it: `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', '')`
- Set `DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ` in settings.py

### Creating an AWS Account

* Use AWS s3 to store static files.
- Create account at https://aws.amazon.com/
- Account type personal
- Go to AWS Management Console.
- Open s3
- Create new bucket
- In Set Permissions, uncheck Block All Public Access

* Bucket settings:
- Properties -> Static Website Hosting
- Use default values index.html and error.html
- Save
- Permissions:
- CORS Configuration:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
<CORSRule>
<AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
<AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
<MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
<AllowedHeader>Authorization</AllowedHeader>
</CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```
- Bucket Policy -> Policy Generator
- Policy Type: s3 Bucket Policy
- Principal: *
- Action: GetObject
- Copy ARN from the other tab eg `arn:aws:s3:::race-hub-ado`
- Add statement
- Generate Policy
- Copy Policy into other tab 'Bucket Policy'
- BEFORE SAVING: add /* into the resource key `"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::race-hub-ado/*",`
- Access Control list -> Public Access -> Tick 'List Objects' and save.

* Use AWS service 'IAM' to connect to the bucket
- Go to IAM
- Click Access Management -> Groups
- Create New Group 'manage-race-hub'
- Click next twice (no policy to attach yet)
- Create Group
- Policies -> Create Policy
- Create Policy
- json tab -> Import managed policy
- Search for s3 and import the s3 Full Access Policy.
- From Bucket Policy in s3, get the arn and edit the json accordingly.
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:*",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::race-hub",
                "arn:aws:s3:::race-hub/*"
                ]
        }
    ]
}
```
- Review Policy
- Add name and description. 
- Create
- Go to Groups -> Select the group -> Permissions tab -> Attach policy -> search and attach.

* users
- Add user
- Include static files access.
- Next: Permisssions
- Add user to group.
- Create user
- ESSENTIAL: Download .csv file.

* Connecting django to Amazon s3.

- `pip3 install boto3`
- `pip3 install django-storages`
- `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`
- Add 'storages' to installed apps in settings.py

- in settings.py:

```
if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
    # Bucket Config
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'race-hub'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'EU (London)'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

    # Static and media files
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
    MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

    # Override static and media URLs in production
    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
    MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
```

- Add these config vars in Heroku: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, USE_AWS.
- Delete Config Var for DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC

- create custom_storages.py in main project folder. NB CHECK this location carefully. It should be at the same level as README.md
```
from django.conf import settings
from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage


class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION


class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
```
- update EU (London) to eu-west-2 in settings.py

* Add cache control:
```
    # Cache control
    AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
        'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
        'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
    }
```

- Go to s3 and create a new folder called media. Upload all product images.
- Grant public permissions.

* Tidying up

- attempt to log in as admin (causes allauth to attempt to verify)
- in django admin panel, verify email address and make primary for the super user account.

* Stripe
- Add Stripe Keys to heroku config vars.
- Add new Stripe Webhook Endpoint. (Remember to tick viewing test data)
- Configure endpoint as follows:
- https://race-hub.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/
- Select Receive all events.
- Add Endpoint.
- Add signing secret to Heroku Config Vars.
- Should now have: STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WH_SECRET - all matched to what exists in settings.py
- send test webhook from Stripe to check.

### Email setup.

* In Gmail:
- Settings (cog)
- Accounts and import
- Other Google Account Settings
- Security
- 2 Step Verification
- Verify
- Turn On
- Under Signing in to Google heading, choose app passwords.
- Create app passwords: Type Mail / Other / enter django in the box.
- Copy the key and enter it in the Heroku app as a config var as EMAIL_HOST_PASS
- Create EMAIL_HOST_USER as the gmail account.

* In settings.py:
```
if 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ:
    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'hello@racehub.com'
else:
    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
    EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
    EMAIL_PORT = 587
    EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_USER')
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_PASS')
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_USER')
```

### Nice to have
- dropdowns open on hover (desktop)



## Navigation
Used advice from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29752882/cant-scroll-within-mobile-drop-down-nav/29753214 to make mobile mega dropdowns scroll on mobile devices
Refactored code, based on: https://codepen.io/JakubHonisek/pen/xXaYqg
Code for mobile view buttons refacroted from Code Institute tutorial



## Home Page App

- Pillow installed to handle image field


## Events App
- Inspiration for Bootstrap cards taken from: https://codepen.io/aminulhchy/pen/RVeJMZ

## Known Issues
- Remove item from cart removes all entries for this event, not the single athlete.

### Testing

Navigation elements from https://codepen.io/skywalkapps/pen/VeNzwG were found to be incompatible with Bootstrap 4.

### References and Acknowledgements:

#### Stripe

Card number for testing with authentication (triggers popup with overlay)

## Deployment

### NB need bulk data import using fixtures for news sets of results, clubs etc:
NB: Fixtures have not been used to upload bulk product data so import of results data etc.

NB: Heroku login ipaddress mismatch error: Use `heroku login -i` to login from terminal rather than opening browser

NB: eu-west-2 for London in django settings.

During Deployment an error was found in the requirements.txt file due to a typo. This was fixed and the deployment process was then successful.

During Deployment a typo was found in Procfile. NB race_hub is the name of the application. race-hub is used in AWS and also as the project name in Heroku.

NB When logging in to deployed app for the first time, to verify email address... this may not appear. Try logging in to front end. This will cause allauth to create the email address in the back end. It can then be verified.

Bug found during deployment. Image urls were incorrectly coded and did not include {{ MEDIA_URL }} path.
