### Nice to have
- dropdowns open on hover (desktop)



## Navigation
Used advice from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29752882/cant-scroll-within-mobile-drop-down-nav/29753214 to make mobile mega dropdowns scroll on mobile devices
Refactored code, based on: https://codepen.io/JakubHonisek/pen/xXaYqg
Code for mobile view buttons refacroted from Code Institute tutorial



## Home Page App

- Pillow installed to handle image field


## Events App
- Inspiration for Bootstrap cards taken from: https://codepen.io/aminulhchy/pen/RVeJMZ

## Known Issues
- Remove item from cart removes all entries for this event, not the single athlete.

### Testing

Navigation elements from https://codepen.io/skywalkapps/pen/VeNzwG were found to be incompatible with Bootstrap 4.
